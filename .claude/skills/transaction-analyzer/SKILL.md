# Transaction Analyzer

Analyze cross-chain transaction logs from the eco-solver system and provide comprehensive data science insights about performance, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.

## What This Skill Does

This skill analyzes JSON log files from the eco-solver system. It automatically detects the log type and adapts analysis:

**Supported Log Types:**

- **Quote Only** - Just quote generation and validation
- **Full Lifecycle** - Complete flow from quote to fulfillment
- **Fulfillment Only** - Intent processing and fulfillment without quote

The skill extracts key metrics, identifies performance bottlenecks, and provides actionable optimization recommendations.

**Key Feature:** For full lifecycle logs, the skill automatically separates **user wait time** (between quote completion and on-chain transaction) from **system processing time**, ensuring accurate performance analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Analyzing production transaction logs
- Investigating performance issues or slow transactions
- Comparing transaction performance over time
- Identifying optimization opportunities
- Debugging cross-chain transaction failures
- Generating performance reports for stakeholders

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get the Log File Path

If the user hasn't provided a log file path, ask:

```
Please provide the path to the transaction log file (JSON format)
```

### Step 2: Run the Analysis Script

Execute the analysis script located in this skill directory:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/transaction-analyzer/analyze.py <log-file-path>
```

The script outputs structured JSON containing all extracted metrics.

### Step 3: Present Comprehensive Findings

Organize your analysis into these sections:

#### 1. Executive Summary

- Log type (quote_only, full_lifecycle, fulfillment_only)
- Total duration (in seconds and human-readable format)
- **Effective processing time** (excluding user wait between quote and transaction)
- **User wait time** (time between quote completion and on-chain transaction) - if applicable
- Transaction route (source chain ‚Üí destination chain)
- Transaction amounts and fees
- Overall success rate
- Key outcome status

**Example (Full Lifecycle):**

```
üìä Executive Summary
- Log Type: Full Lifecycle
- Total Duration: 169.78 seconds (~2.8 minutes)
- Effective Processing Time: 142.90 seconds
- User Wait Time: 26.88 seconds (quote ‚Üí on-chain transaction)
- Transaction: 0.78 USDC (Base) ‚Üí 0.75 USDC (Optimism)
- Fee: 0.03 USDC (4%)
- Success Rate: 100% (no retries needed)
```

**Example (Quote Only):**

```
üìä Executive Summary
- Log Type: Quote Only
- Duration: 0.613 seconds
- Transaction: 0.78 USDC (Base) ‚Üí 0.75 USDC (Optimism)
- Fee: 0.03 USDC (4%)
- All Validations: ‚úÖ Passed
```

#### 2. Transaction Economics

Present in a table format:

| Metric                            | Value               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| User Sends (Source Chain)         | Amount + Token      |
| User Receives (Destination Chain) | Amount + Token      |
| Solver Fee                        | Amount + Percentage |
| Gas Overhead Estimate             | Gas units           |
| Source Token Address              | Address             |
| Destination Token Address         | Address             |

#### 3. Performance Breakdown

For each major phase, show duration and status:

**Phase 1: Quote Generation** (target: <1s)

- Total duration
- Sub-operations (validation, balance checks, fee calculation)
- Status: ‚úÖ Optimized / ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern / üî¥ Critical

**Phase 2: Blockchain Confirmation** (network-dependent)

- Wait time for on-chain confirmation
- Block number and transaction hash
- Status indicator

**Phase 3: Intent Processing**

- Intent detection time
- Feasibility check duration (often the bottleneck)
- Token mapping operations
- Status indicator

**Phase 4: Fulfillment**

- Wallet fulfillment time
- Transaction construction time
- Status indicator

#### 4. Bottleneck Analysis

Identify and rank the longest operations:

```
üîç BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS

Longest Operations:
‚Ä¢ Intent Feasibility Check: 18.58s (11% of total) üî¥ CRITICAL
‚Ä¢ Blockchain Confirmation: 26.88s (15.8% of total) ‚ö†Ô∏è Network Constraint
‚Ä¢ Wallet Fulfillment: 1.51s (0.9% of total) ‚úÖ Efficient
‚Ä¢ Quote Generation: 0.57s (0.3% of total) ‚úÖ Excellent
```

Use these indicators:

- ‚úÖ Optimized: <1s or within expected range
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern: Needs attention (5-10s)
- üî¥ Critical: Major bottleneck (>10s)

#### 5. Validation Results

List all validation checks with pass/fail status:

- ‚úÖ Supported native transfers
- ‚úÖ Supported prover
- ‚úÖ Supported targets
- ‚úÖ Valid transfer limits
- ‚úÖ Sufficient balance
- ‚úÖ Cross-chain fulfillment validated

#### 6. Chain Activity

- Number of balance queries performed
- Chains queried (with chain IDs and names)
- Wallet addresses involved
- Transaction hashes and block numbers
- Intent hashes

#### 7. Error & Retry Analysis

- Total errors/failures
- Retry attempts on critical path
- Success rate percentage
- Details of any failed jobs (with context)

#### 8. Optimization Recommendations

Rank by impact (High/Medium/Low):

**HIGH IMPACT**: Operations that could save >10 seconds

- Current duration ‚Üí target duration
- Estimated time savings
- Percentage improvement

**MEDIUM IMPACT**: Operations that could save 2-10 seconds

- Specific recommendations
- Implementation considerations

**LOW IMPACT**: Operations that could save <2 seconds

- Minor optimizations
- Nice-to-have improvements

**Calculate Potential Total Time Reduction:**

```
Current: 169.78s ‚Üí Optimized: ~120s (30% improvement)
```

#### 9. Business Insights

- **Fee Competitiveness**: Compare to market benchmarks (2-3% excellent, 3-5% competitive)
- **User Experience**: Assess total time vs user expectations (<2 min good, >5 min poor)
- **System Reliability**: Zero retries indicates robust validation
- **Resource Efficiency**: Balance query optimization opportunities

#### 10. Key Data Science Metrics

Summary statistics:
