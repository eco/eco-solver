/**
 * Calculates the total compounded slippage from an array of individual slippages.

 * Each slippage value represents the fractional loss at a swap step (e.g., 0.02 for 2%).
 * Slippage is compounded multiplicatively â€” the output of one step becomes the input of the next.
 *
 * @param slippages - An array of slippage percentages, expressed as decimal numbers (e.g., 0.01 for 1%).
 * @returns The total slippage across all steps, as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const total = getTotalSlippage([0.01, 0.02, 0.015]);
 * console.log(total); // 0.0443 (or 4.43%)
 * ```
